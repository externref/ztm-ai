**Deep learning** is a type of **machine learning** that uses **artificial neural networks**—models inspired by how the human brain works—to learn from large amounts of data.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers

## Traditional Programming v/s Machine Learning

| Feature               | Traditional Programming | Machine Learning              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Who writes the logic? | Human (programmer)      | Computer (learns from data)   |
| Input required        | Data + Rules            | Data + Labels (output)        |
| Output                | Computed result         | Learned model or prediction   |
| Handles uncertainty?  | Poorly                  | Very well (learns from noise) |

## Why deep learning

* problems with long sets of rules
* continually changing environments
* discovering insights with large collection of data
#### Examples using deep learning
Website recommendations, Translations, Speech Recognition, Computer vision, NLP ( Natural Language Processing ), SeqToSeq stuff

## When to not use deep learning

* problems solvable with simple programming logic
* when explainability is required
* when errors are unacceptable
* amount of data to train on is less
