Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by how the human brain processes information. Theyâ€™re used to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and game playing.

Learns representations like patterns, features and weights from numerically encoded data and creates an output with certain inbound possibilities.

## Anatomy of Neural Networks

##### Input Layer
Data goes into this layer to be processed
##### Hidden Layers
Learns patterns and weightage in data
##### Output Layers
Outputs learned representations or prediction possibilities

### Types of Learning

* Supervised learning ( data has labels )
* Semi-supervised learning ( data has a few labels )
* Unsupervised learning ( data no labels )
* Transfer learning/Reinforced ( taking predictions from one set of data and use it for other data )

## TensorFlow

* TensorFlow is an end-to-end platform for ML in python/other languages runnable on a GPU/TPU
* You can access certain pre-build deep learning models from the TensorFlow hub
* It can preprocess and model data and deploy models live
* Backed by google

## Tensors

The numerically encoded input and output data in a neural network is a tensor.
