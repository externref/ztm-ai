In **deep learning (DL)**, **regression** refers to a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to **predict a continuous numerical value** given an input. It's different from classification, which predicts discrete labels or categories.

### Regression Analysis

**Regression analysis** is a **statistical technique** used to examine the **relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables**. In the context of machine learning and deep learning, it refers to building models that can predict **continuous numeric outcomes** based on input data.
